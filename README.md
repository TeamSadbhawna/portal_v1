<p>
Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. So here we are Team Sadbhawna launching our first release of
our Web-Portal SADBHAWNA where recovered COVID-19 patients can donate any medecines ,supplements etc which you think 
can be helpful to others in need.
</p>
We make a heartful request for everyone to please come forward and contribute here. Your contribution in a small way may help many in their battle against COVID-19.
