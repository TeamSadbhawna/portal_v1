  <h3> A portal where recovered COVID-19 patients can share their resources. </h3>
</center>
<p>
Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. So here we are Team Sadbhawna launching our first release of
our Web-Portal SADBHAWNA where recovered COVID-19 patients can donate any medecines ,supplements etc which you think 
can be helpful to others in need.
</p>
We make a heartful request for everyone to please come forward and contribute here. Your contribution in a small way may help many in their battle against COVID-19.


# Note - This was our beta release considering time constraints, later we moved to to this awesome new UI. Check out our final project [here](https://github.com/TeamSadbhawna/portal).
